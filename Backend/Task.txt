(1. Router
all the paths are / only(from single router.js )
[get ,post ,put,update,delete];

Way of doing task 

for our auth model we have to set 

1.post request (/login)
2.post request (/signin)

login component in controller 

signin component in jwt

In diff folder see the wrokflow study past code 

see through tut and confirm from docs and gpt 

3.models in mongodb
4. front end form using use form and protected routing
)




Our approach
>Backend(main backend folder )
Configure/configure.js all the data(pass, port)
Controller/userController.js controll or the functionality of the code main functions like login signup with (req,res)=> callback 
Router/userDataRoute.js routes the user data with express.Router() holding this in const  and export this const


index.js main file of backend (server) using middleware use.('url need to add',router);
